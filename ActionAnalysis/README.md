# Action Analysis

This tool analyzes compiled Unity assemblies to generate data to be used to inform agents of the possible game actions and their relevant inputs. 
The implementation in this directory is a heavily evolved/modified version of our FDG 2022 paper's code, which can be found here: [https://github.com/USC-SQL/UnityActionAnalysis](https://github.com/USC-SQL/UnityActionAnalysis).
